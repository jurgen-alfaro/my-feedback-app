No need to import React in the components


PropTypes = type checking
- Specify what type a variable is to make the app more robust.

There are libraries to style components
- Material UI
- Styled components

State = data
There are two types of State
1. Component level state
---- This is specific to the component, no other component needs to access this.
2. App level state
---- The state is shared among other components in the app

The state in react is something inmutable, so it cannot be changed directly. 
That is why you need to use hooks, to reset the value(s) of the state. 

Hooks: 

useState() => You need this to update the state of a functional component
  const [rating, setRating] = useState(7);

Whenever you use the map() function you need to return a value. 
To return a value, make sure you use parenthesis if there's only one line! 
<div className='feedback-list'>
  {feedback.map((item) => (
    <FeedbackItem key={item.id} item={item} />
  ))}
</div>

The './src/shared/' folder is used to share components amongs the app. All the components that should be used in different places should bee in here.
